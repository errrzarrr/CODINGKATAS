# Code Katas

### Practice makes the Master

Personally I don't believe you learn coding by doing *exactly* the same again, again and again day after day, week after week. However, and don't get me wrong here please, practicing with variations, increasing difficulty, different methods, language, approach or paradigm will get you better each time. If last last month you made a Kata in simple functional PHP, this month you should repeat it using Object-Oriented PHP. If you learn Python this year then repeat your old PHP katas in Python. You did a Kata in Java but didn't know about TDD, the Test Driven develop it now. *THIS way you will achieve mastery!*
