# Code Katas

### Practice makes the Master

#### Kinetics 
In Sports and Martial Arts — where we developers took the *kata* term from — where you practice by doing body and mental concentration execution it helps by solely repeating the same again and again.

#### Intelectual and Creative
We developers do an intelectual and creative work; which means what we produce comes from the mind, rational and imagination. Though we do *katas* here we are very different from martial artists, because there is no kinects — movement — involved. Which we should do more often for the sake of our health, but that's another topic.  What helps us improve is doing and learning different things each time, even if it's the same using a different approach. 

* New challenges each time be welcomed.
* Talking face-to-face about coding issues with colleagues and how they solved it.
* Sharing your solutions using **git**.
* Refactoring.
* Rewrite your code using __Clean Code__ recommendations.

Personally I don't believe you learn coding by doing *exactly* the same again, again and again day after day, week after week. However, and don't get me wrong here please, practicing with variations, increasing difficulty, different methods, language, approach or paradigm will get you better each time. If last month you made a Kata in simple functional PHP, this month you should repeat it using Object-Oriented PHP. If you learn Python this year then repeat your old PHP katas in Python. When you did a Java Kata didn't know about TDD? then Test-Driven-Develop it now. *THIS way you will achieve mastery!*

I firmly believe practice makes the master that's why this ![repository](https://github.com/errrzarrr/CODINGKATAS) was made for, for allocating katas (or practices, or exercices, you name it) I've been solving.

If you want my help or you want I see your approach to an issue you just have to _mention_ me just by typing `@errrzarrr`.  Yes, mention like you do on facebook.

Feel free to `fork` and share back what you did.
