# Fizz Buzz Kata


#### A Traditional popular game for kids.

_Fizz Buzz_ is a word game for children whose purpose is to teach them about division and quick thinking. 

The game goes on by first player starts saying number "1" then next player says next number and so on. If that number is _divisible by 3_ that player says _Fizz_ instead. When facing a number _divisible by 5_ say _Buzz_ instead. Numbers _divisible by both_ becomes _Fizz Buzz_. Up to this point it seems, and it is, a simple game. Where's the issue?


#### The Issue

For my surprise some days ago I came across a facebook conversation where someone stated Developers can't even print in screen the output for this game. For developers the _Fizz Buzz Test_ is an job interview question. Some authors affirm this challenge _filters out_ a number as big as __99%__ of job candidates. This digit might sound exagerated for you, so it does for me. But it is perfectly possible there's a high number of candidates failing this test. It seems there's something wrong in code interviews all around the world because a new, innovative and changing high tech discipline is being  measured by old traditional methods. 

However, I won't focus on this aspect for it isn't our purpose here. There could be more than one reason for this:

- Interviewees get nervous by the mere nature of the job interview itself then don't listen to question as they should. Under this circumstances they don't deliver right solutions. This happens to any kind of interviewee of any career. It's just human nature.

- Developers are used to (and spoilt by) extremely difficult task. They expect complex task to solve presented by enigmatic prose. When faced to easy challenges as _Fizz Buzz_ they can't even believe the simpleness of the task and are prone to think there's something hidden. A hook to make them fail.

If this is the Fizz Buzz Test purpose (A hook to make them fail) then it has succeeded by a vast amount. 

> A problem so easy to solve that no one is expecting and thus they fail.


#### A Kata to demistify it.

>  The Fizz Buzz solutions is easier than the issue itself.

So in order to not get drawn by this easy task what a developer should do is just practice it. Solve it at home.
